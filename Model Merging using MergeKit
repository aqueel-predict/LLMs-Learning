        "What is MergeKit?\n",
        "\n",
        "MergeKit is an open-source toolkit designed to merge pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs). Its main selling point is efficiency: it allows you to merge massive models on consumer hardware (even just a CPU or a GPU with as little as 8GB VRAM) using an \"out-of-core\" approach, meaning it doesn't need to load the whole model into memory at once.\n",
        "Why use it? (The Benefits)\n",
        "\n",
        "Instead of spending thousands of dollars and months of time training a new model, MergeKit allows you to:\n",
        "\n",
        "    Combine Strengths: Take one model good at coding and another good at storytelling and fuse them.\n",
        "\n",
        "    Transfer Skills: Move capabilities from one model to another without needing the original training data.\n",
        "\n",
        "    Create New Capabilities: Discover new behaviors that emerge when models are combined.\n",
        "\n",
        "How it Works: The \"Recipe\" (YAML)\n",
        "\n",
        "To use MergeKit, you write a YAML configuration file (a recipe). This file controls every aspect of the merge:\n",
        "\n",
        "    Merge Method: The algorithm used to mix the models (see below).\n",
        "\n",
        "    Models: You list which models you want to use (e.g., Llama-3, Mistral).\n",
        "\n",
        "    Slices/Layers: You can choose to merge only specific layers or stack layers from different models (known as \"Frankenmerging\").\n",
        "\n",
        "    Parameters: You set weights (how much influence each model has) and density (how many parameters are kept).\n",
        "\n",
        "    Tokenizer: It can automatically create a \"Union\" tokenizer, combining the vocabularies of different models (e.g., merging a model that knows ChatML tokens with one that knows Llama-3 tokens).\n",
        "\n",
        "Supported Merge Algorithms\n",
        "\n",
        "The toolkit supports many complex math strategies to ensure models don't break when mixed. Key methods include:\n",
        "\n",
        "    TIES (used for Neuro-Orchestrator): Uses \"Task Arithmetic\" to find the most important changes in a model and resolves conflicts between models.\n",
        "\n",
        "    SLERP (Spherical Linear Interpolation): The standard for merging two models; it smoothly transitions between their weights.\n",
        "\n",
        "    DARE: Randomly prunes (removes) small changes to keep only the most robust skills, often used with TIES.\n",
        "\n",
        "    Passthrough: Literally just copies layers. Used to stack models on top of each other to make them larger (e.g., turning two 7B models into a 10B model).\n",
        "\n",
        "    Mixture of Experts (MoE): Instead of blending weights, it keeps models separate but bundles them into a single \"MoE\" architecture (like Mixtral), where a \"router\" decides which model answers which part of a prompt.\n",
        "\n",
        "Advanced Features\n",
        "\n",
        "    LoRA Extraction: It can extract a LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) from a fine-tuned model, effectively reversing the fine-tuning process so you can apply that \"adapter\" to other models.\n",
        "\n",
        "    Cross-Tokenizer Merging: Using a tool called tokensurgeon, it can transplant vocabularies between models."
